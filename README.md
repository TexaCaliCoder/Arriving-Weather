# Weather Arriving
This Project is an assessment for First Arriving. 


### First Arriving Code Exercise


Weâ€™d like you to complete the code challenge below. Please work on this application in
Bitbucket or GitHub, and commit often so we can see your progress working through the
problem. You may use any dependencies you feel are appropriate.

#### Technical Exercise:
You have been tasked to create a basic, web-based digital dashboard which displays the
weather forecast for the following day at the First Arriving office: 9555 Kings Charter Drive,
Ashland VA 23005. Please use the publicly available National Weather Service API found here:
https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api. The forecast should be refreshed
automatically once every 10 minutes.
